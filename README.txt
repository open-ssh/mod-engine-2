SEO OPTIMIZATION TIPS

‚úì Keywords are naturally integrated in content
‚úì Internal linking is set up for better navigation
‚úì Semantic HTML is used (header, section, footer)
‚úì Meta descriptions are included in each page

To improve SEO further:

5. Add structured data (Schema.org markup)

=====================================

4. Update the <title> and meta tags
5. Add a link to this page in the navigation menu of all other pages:
   
   <li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a></li>

6. Add the same footer and navigation structure

=====================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=====================================

Issue: Navigation menu not working on mobile
Solution: Make sure script.js is properly linked in all HTML files

Issue: Styles not applying
Solution: Check that style.css is in the same folder as HTML files

Issue: Links not working
Solution: Ensure all URLs are correct and include https:// for external links

Issue: Google Form not opening
Solution: Verify the Google Form link is correct and set to accept responses

Issue: Website looks different on mobile
Solution: This is expected - the design is responsive and adapts to screen size

=====================================
PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
=====================================

Your website is already optimized, but for even better performance:

1. Compress images before adding them (use TinyPNG or similar)
2. Minify CSS and JavaScript files (use online minifiers)
3. Enable browser caching on your web server
4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets
5. Enable GZIP compression on your server

=====================================
SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
=====================================

‚úì All external links use rel="noopener" for security
‚úì No inline JavaScript (all in separate script.js)
‚úì No sensitive data in client-side code
‚úì Forms use HTTPS (Google Forms)
